# MattrMindr — Criminal Defense Case Management System

## Overview
A case management system for the Mobile County Public Defender's Office. Tracks criminal defense cases and matters, manages deadlines, assigns tasks, tracks charges and custody/bond status, performs conflict checks, and generates office-wide reports.

## Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 (Create React App), port 5000
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express 4, port 3001
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Replit-provisioned), accessed via `DATABASE_URL`
- **Auth**: express-session with bcrypt password hashing; temporary password emails via SendGrid
- **Email**: SendGrid (Replit integration) for auth emails; SendGrid Inbound Parse for case correspondence
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS template literal injected at runtime via `<style>` tag

## Running the App
Workflow: `npm start` (root) — runs both Express API and React app via `concurrently`
Login: email + password (existing users default: `1234`, new users get temp password via email)

## Deployment
- **Target**: autoscale
- **Build**: `cd lextrack && npm run build`
- **Run**: `NODE_ENV=production node server/index.js` (serves API + React build on port 5000)
- In production: Express serves static React build, secure cookies enabled, trust proxy set

## Architecture Notes
- **DB migration path**: All DB access via REST API — swap `DATABASE_URL` to point to Supabase, swap `express-session` for JWT, done.
- **Standard SQL only**: No Replit-specific extensions — schema is portable.
- **Task chains**: Completing certain tasks auto-generates follow-up tasks — business logic stays client-side.
- **Auto-escalation**: Task priority rises automatically as due date approaches.
- **Activity logging**: Tracked per-case via `/api/activity`.
