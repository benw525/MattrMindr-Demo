# MattrMindr — Criminal Defense Case Management System

## Overview
A case management system for the Mobile County Public Defender's Office. Tracks criminal defense cases, manages deadlines, assigns tasks, tracks charges and custody/bond status, performs conflict checks, and generates office-wide reports.

## Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 (Create React App), port 5000
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express 4, port 3001
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Replit-provisioned), accessed via `DATABASE_URL`
- **Auth**: express-session with bcrypt password hashing; temporary password emails via SendGrid
- **Email**: SendGrid (Replit integration) for auth emails; SendGrid Inbound Parse for case correspondence
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS template literal injected at runtime via `<style>` tag

## Running the App
Workflow: `npm start` (root) — runs both Express API and React app via `concurrently`
Login: email + password (existing users default: `1234`, new users get temp password via email)

## Deployment
- **Target**: autoscale
- **Build**: `cd lextrack && npm run build`
- **Run**: `NODE_ENV=production node server/index.js` (serves API + React build on port 5000)
- In production: Express serves static React build, secure cookies enabled, trust proxy set

### AI Agents (server/routes/ai-agents.js)
Nine AI-powered agents using OpenAI (`gpt-4o-mini`) via existing integration. All API calls use `store: false` to prevent data retention and model training:
1. **Charge Analysis** — Analyzes Alabama Code sections, sentencing ranges, mandatory minimums, diversion eligibility. Available in New Case modal (after entering charges) and case detail Overview tab
2. **Deadline Generator** — Generates procedural deadlines based on Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure and case stage. In case detail deadlines section with "Suggest" button; each suggestion has one-click "Add" to create real deadline records
3. **Case Strategy** — Full defense strategy analysis including motions, plea negotiation, sentencing exposure, investigation priorities. Death penalty cases get capital-specific analysis. "Strategy" button in case detail header; results can be saved as case notes
4. **Document Drafting** — Generates first drafts of motions (suppress, dismiss, bond reduction, continuance, discovery, plea agreement, sentencing memo, speedy trial). "AI Draft" button in case detail header opens modal with document type selector
5. **Case Triage** — Ranks active cases by urgency (death penalty, trial dates, custody, overdue tasks). Dashboard widget (add via Customize) and "Triage" button in Cases view topbar. Each result shows urgency score (1-10), reason, and next action
6. **Client Communication Summary** — Plain-language case status update for sharing with clients/families. "Client Summary" button in case detail Overview tab with copy functionality
7. **Document Summary** — Summarizes uploaded case documents (police reports, witness statements, lab reports, etc.) for defense-relevant details. Extracts key facts/timeline, people mentioned, inconsistencies, Miranda/constitutional issues, chain of custody, and bottom-line takeaway. Available in Documents tab of case detail overlay (per-document summarize button) and AI Center (paste text for standalone summarization). Document types: Police Report, Witness Statement, Lab/Forensic Report, Mental Health Evaluation, Prior Record/PSI, Discovery Material, Medical Records, Body Cam/Dash Cam Transcript, Court Order, Plea Agreement, Expert Report, Other
8. **Task Suggestions** — Analyzes case details (charges, stage, custody, deadlines, existing tasks, notes, co-defendants) and suggests 5-8 concrete defense tasks. Each suggestion includes title, priority, assigned role, rationale, and due date. One-click "Add" or "Add All" buttons to create real tasks. Death penalty cases get capital-specific suggestions. Available in case detail Tasks section ("Suggest Tasks" button) and AI Center
9. **Filing Classifier** — Classifies court filings by analyzing extracted PDF text. Returns suggested name, filing party (State, Defendant, Co-Defendant, Court, Other), document type, filing date, and summary. Auto-updates the filing record. Auto-triggered on upload and email-received filings. Available per-filing in Filings tab ("Classify" button) and AI Center (select case → select filing → classify)

All agents accessible via `/api/ai-agents/*` endpoints, require authentication. Frontend API helpers in `api.js`. Reusable `AiPanel` component for consistent UI rendering. Charge Analysis and Deadline Generator endpoints accept `caseId` to auto-load case data server-side.

### AI Center
- Centralized view in sidebar (under Reports) that provides access to all 9 AI agents from one place
- Agent cards in a responsive grid; selecting one opens the agent panel with case selector (for agents that need a case)
- Case Triage runs without case selection; all others require choosing a case first
- Document Drafting includes document type selector and optional instructions field
- Results rendered via shared `AiPanel` component with copy functionality

### Mobile Responsiveness
- **Breakpoints**: 768px (tablet/mobile) and 480px (small mobile)
- **Sidebar**: Collapsible on mobile — hidden by default with slide-in animation via `.sidebar.open` class. Hamburger button (☰) visible in every view's topbar via `.hamburger-btn` (hidden on desktop). Backdrop overlay closes sidebar on tap. All nav items auto-close sidebar on click
- **Hamburger prop**: Each view component receives `onMenuToggle` prop for the hamburger button
- **Grids**: `.grid4` → 2 columns at 768px, 1 column at 480px. `.grid2` and `.form-row` → 1 column at 768px
- **Modals**: `.modal` class uses `width: calc(100vw - 24px) !important; max-width: 620px` at 768px. All inline-width modals have `maxWidth: "calc(100vw - 24px)"` fallback
- **Case Overlay**: Full-width (`left: 0`) on mobile; header wraps, tabs scroll horizontally, body padding reduced
- **Tables**: Lower-priority columns hidden via `.hide-mobile` class (Case Type, Defendant, Arrest Date, Lead). `SortTh` component accepts `className` prop for this. Table cell padding reduced
- **Touch targets**: Buttons get `min-height: 40px` on mobile (36px for btn-sm)
- **Login box**: Responsive with max-width constraint
- **Detail panel** (`.detail-panel`): Full-width on mobile
- **Edit fields**: Stack label/value vertically at 480px via `flex-wrap: wrap`

## Architecture Notes
- **DB migration path**: All DB access via REST API — swap `DATABASE_URL` to point to Supabase, swap `express-session` for JWT, done.
- **Standard SQL only**: No Replit-specific extensions — schema is portable.
- **Task chains**: Completing certain tasks auto-generates follow-up tasks — business logic stays client-side.
- **Auto-escalation**: Task priority rises automatically as due date approaches.
- **Activity logging**: Tracked per-case via `/api/activity`.
