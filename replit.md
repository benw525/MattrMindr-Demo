# MattrMindr — Personal Injury Case Management System

## Overview
A case management system for personal injury law firms. Tracks PI cases, manages deadlines and statutes of limitations, assigns tasks, tracks medical treatments/insurance/damages/liens/negotiations, performs conflict checks, and generates office-wide reports. Supports multi-state jurisdiction-aware AI agents.

## Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 (Create React App), port 5000
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express 4, port 3001
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Replit-provisioned), accessed via `DATABASE_URL`
- **Auth**: express-session with bcrypt password hashing; session restore on page refresh via `/api/auth/me`; temporary passwords hashed with bcrypt before storage (column: `temp_password_hash`); SESSION_SECRET required in production; login form wrapped in `<form>` for proper browser autofill/submit; rate limiting on login/MFA/forgot-password routes via express-rate-limit; session invalidation on password change, user deactivation, role change, and temp password send
- **Email**: SendGrid (Replit integration) for auth emails; SendGrid Inbound Parse for case correspondence
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3 + CSS-in-JS template literal; Inter font, slate/amber color palette, lucide-react icons
- **Icons**: All AI Center agent cards and Reports page cards use lucide-react Icon components with colored rounded-lg background containers
- **OCR**: Tiered Gemini OCR pipeline via `@google/generative-ai`: 1) `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` sends PDF directly (fastest), 2) falls back to `gemini-2.0-flash` with image-based extraction (converts pages to JPEG, compresses oversized images with `sharp`, reduces DPI for PDFs >50MB), 3) falls back to tesseract.js; no page limit
- **Page-tagged OCR**: `extractTextWithPages()` in `server/utils/extract-text.js` returns text with `[PAGE N]` markers. Uses `pdf-parse` pagerender first (for digital PDFs), falls back to Gemini/Tesseract with per-page tagging. Used by medical record parsing for accurate page references.
- **OpenAI**: Centralized client in `server/utils/openai.js` (single `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var, `store: false` enforced globally to prevent training on attorney-client privileged data). No `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_*` env vars — all routes use the shared wrapper.
- **File Storage (R2)**: Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible) for file storage with BYTEA fallback. Set `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME` to enable. When R2 is configured, uploads go to R2 and `file_data`/`audio_data` columns are set to NULL; downloads serve presigned URL redirects (5 min expiry). When R2 is not configured, files stored in PostgreSQL BYTEA columns. All routes handle both modes. Backfill script: `node server/scripts/migrate-bytea-to-r2.js`. Key patterns: `documents/{caseId}/{uuid}/{filename}`, `filings/...`, `voicemails/...`, `templates/{uuid}/{name}`, `medical-records/...`, `demonstratives/...`, `profile-pictures/{userId}/{uuid}`, `transcripts/{caseId}/{uuid}/{filename}`.
- **Field Encryption**: AES-256-GCM at-rest encryption for sensitive columns (client_ssn, ms_access_token, ms_refresh_token, ms_account_email, scribe_token, voirdire_token, mfa_secret) via `server/utils/encryption.js`. Optional: set `FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (64-char hex) to enable. Without the key, fields stored as plaintext. Migration script: `node server/scripts/encrypt-existing-fields.js`
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas in `server/middleware/validate.js` for all high-risk routes: auth (login, MFA, forgot/reset/change-password), portal auth, external auth, case create, AI agents (liability-analysis, deadline-generator, case-strategy, draft-document, client-summary, task-suggestions, classify-filing, doc-summary, advocate), SMS send, document folders, batch delete/move. Includes type coercion for integer IDs, string length caps, enum validation, E.164 phone format, and pagination limits.
- **Database Migrations**: `node-pg-migrate` manages schema changes via numbered migration files in `server/migrations/`. Migrations run automatically at startup via `server/utils/migrate-runner.js`. CLI: `npm run migrate:up`, `migrate:down`, `migrate:create` in server/. Migration state tracked in `pgmigrations` table.
- **Backups**: `deploy/backup.sh` — pg_dump cron template with retention policy (7 daily, 4 weekly, 6 monthly). Optional S3 sync via `S3_BUCKET` env var. Recovery procedures documented in `RECOVERY.md`.
- **Medical Record Staging**: Upload/from-document routes return staged entries for preview; user reviews with Add All/Discard/per-entry remove; commit endpoint saves selected entries
- **Medical Record Parsing**: AI extracts per-visit: provider, date, body part treated, procedures/treatments, pain levels, progress notes, diagnoses/ICD codes, objective findings, referrals. Entries with no meaningful clinical detail are omitted. `body_part` column in `medical_records` table.
- **System Dependencies**: ffmpeg (Nix package, required for audio transcription), pdftoppm (for PDF-to-image conversion during OCR)
- **Design Packages**: tailwindcss@3.4.19, postcss, autoprefixer, lucide-react (in lextrack/package.json devDependencies)

## Running the App
Workflow: `npm start` (root) — runs both Express API and React app via `concurrently`
Login: email + password (existing users default: `1234`, new users get temp password via email)

## Deployment
- **Replit Target**: autoscale
- **Build**: `npm install && cd server && npm install && cd ../lextrack && npm install && CI=false npm run build`
- **Run**: `NODE_ENV=production node server/index.js` (serves API + React build on port 5000)
- **Note**: `CI=false` is required because Replit's deployment sets `CI=true`, which causes `react-scripts build` to treat ESLint warnings as errors
- **EC2/Self-hosted**: See `deploy/EC2_SETUP_GUIDE.md` — Nginx config, PM2 ecosystem file, systemd unit, and `.env.example` are in the `deploy/` directory
- **Email**: Supports both Replit SendGrid integration (auto-detected) and direct `SENDGRID_API_KEY` + `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` env vars
- **App URL**: Set `APP_URL` env var for password reset links on self-hosted; falls back to `REPLIT_DEV_DOMAIN` on Replit
- **Session/CORS**: `CORS_ORIGIN` env var for custom domain CORS; `TRUST_PROXY` for reverse proxy depth; `DB_SSL` for database SSL mode

- **Login**: Separate `client_users` table, fully isolated from firm sessions (uses `req.session.clientId` + `req.session.isClient`)
- **Invite Flow**: Firm staff invite clients from case detail's "Client Portal" tab → generates temp password → optional welcome email via SendGrid
- **Portal Settings** (`client_portal_settings`): Per-case toggle switches controlling what clients can see (stage, attorney name, case type, accident date, court date, documents, messaging, medical treatments, negotiations, case value) + custom status message
- **Portal Features**:
  - Case progress timeline (PI stages mapped to client-friendly labels)
  - Case info cards (filtered by visibility settings)
  - Messaging (client ↔ firm, chat-style thread via `client_messages` table)
  - Document upload (client uploads marked with `source='client'`) + view firm-shared documents
  - "What to Expect" section explaining the PI process
  - Attorney / firm contact info
- **Firm-Side Management**: "Client Portal" tab in case detail view with settings toggles, client user management, and message reply
- **Documents**: `case_documents.source` column distinguishes `'firm'` (default) vs `'client'` uploads; firm Documents tab shows "Client Upload" badge
- **Files**: `server/routes/portal-auth.js`, `server/routes/portal-case.js`, `server/routes/portal-admin.js`, `server/middleware/clientAuth.js`, `lextrack/src/portal/PortalApp.js`, `lextrack/src/portal/portalApi.js`
- **Firm Login**: "Click here if you are a client" link on firm login screen navigates to `/portal`

### MFA / Two-Factor Authentication
- TOTP-based MFA using `otplib` and `qrcode` packages
- Users enable MFA in Settings modal (Security section) → generates QR code → verify with authenticator app
- Login flow: password verified → if MFA enabled, returns `{ requireMfa: true }` → user enters 6-digit TOTP code → session created
- Routes: `POST /api/auth/mfa/setup`, `/mfa/verify-setup`, `/mfa/verify`, `/mfa/disable`
- DB columns: `users.mfa_secret TEXT`, `users.mfa_enabled BOOLEAN`

### Remember Me (30-Day Session)

- Creates `case_transcripts` entry with `uploaded_by_name = "Email: {sender}"`
- Calls `processTranscription()` from transcripts.js for background Whisper transcription
- Whisper API requires direct OpenAI key (`OPENAI_API_KEY` env var); Replit AI integration proxy does not support audio transcription endpoints. If Whisper returns 404/400/422/501, a clear error message is stored in `error_message` column

### Filings Email Handling
- Dedicated email: `filings@plaintiff.mattrmindr.com` (requires SendGrid Inbound Parse DNS/MX config)
- Emails to `filings@` are parsed for court case number in subject line (format: `XX-XX-YYYY-NNNNNN.NN`, e.g., `21-CV-2025-900012.00`)

- Files ≤20MB continue using standard single-request upload

### Unread Client Communication Widget
- Dashboard widget showing unread messages and document uploads from the client portal
- Backend endpoint: `GET /api/portal-admin/unread-summary` — groups unread client messages (`read_at IS NULL`) and unviewed client documents (`firm_viewed_at IS NULL`) by case, filtered to only cases assigned to the logged-in staff member (lead_attorney, second_attorney, case_manager, investigator, paralegal, or custom_team); App Admins see all cases
- Widget shows case name with client name, clickable to open case's correspondence tab, with message/document counters
- DB column: `case_documents.firm_viewed_at TIMESTAMPTZ` for tracking when firm views client-uploaded docs
- Advocate AI has full context of unread client communication when on the dashboard (message previews, document names, per-case counts)

- Endpoints: `GET /api/deleted-data` (list all soft-deleted records grouped by type), `POST /api/deleted-data/restore` (restore by type+id), `POST /api/deleted-data/purge` (permanently remove expired)
- Frontend: `DeletedDataView` component shows grouped items with name, case reference, deletion date, days remaining until permanent removal, and restore button

### Voir Dire Cause Strikes
- Each cause challenge card now displays both the Reason (`cc.reason || cc.basis`) and the Argument (`cc.argument`) as separate labeled fields

### Default Tasks (auto-created for new cases)
Initial Client Interview → Send Preservation Letters → Obtain Police Report → Identify Insurance Policies → Check for Conflicts → Order Medical Records

### Recurring Call Tasks
- On case creation, auto-creates two recurring 30-day tasks: "Call Client - Attorney Check-in" (assigned to lead attorney) and "Call Client - Case Manager Check-in" (assigned to case manager)

- Per-treatment filters: Provider dropdown, From/To date range
- "Select from Documents" option imports existing case documents → uses already-extracted text when available
- Auto-fills treatment fields (provider name, first/last visit dates) from parsed records when empty
- File sizes display in KB/MB/GB as appropriate throughout the app
- All gpt-5-mini calls use `max_completion_tokens` (not `max_tokens`)
