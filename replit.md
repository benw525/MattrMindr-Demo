# MattrMindr — Case Management System

## Overview
A legal practice management app for Webster Henry law firm. Tracks civil litigation cases and matters, manages deadlines, assigns tasks, and generates firm-wide reports.

## Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19 (Create React App), port 5000
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express 4, port 3001
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Replit-provisioned), accessed via `DATABASE_URL`
- **Auth**: express-session with bcrypt password hashing; temporary password emails via SendGrid
- **Email**: SendGrid (Replit integration) for auth emails; SendGrid Inbound Parse for case correspondence
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS template literal injected at runtime via `<style>` tag

## Running the App
Workflow: `npm start` (root) — runs both Express API and React app via `concurrently`
Login: email + password (existing users default: `1234`, new users get temp password via email)

## Deployment
- **Target**: autoscale
- **Build**: `cd lextrack && npm run build`
- **Run**: `NODE_ENV=production node server/index.js` (serves API + React build on port 5000)
- In production: Express serves static React build, secure cookies enabled, trust proxy set

- Contacts: auto-populated contacts (Clients, Attorneys, Courts + manual Experts/Miscellaneous), with phone/email/fax/address, associated cases, persistent notes, and soft-delete with 30-day recovery. Category-specific fields: Attorney→Firm, Adjuster/Expert→Company, Court→County. Attorney and Court contacts support Staff accordion (debounced auto-save, accordion UI like case parties). Attorney staff types: Legal Assistant, Paralegal, Receptionist, Other. Court staff types: Judicial Assistant, Clerk, Court Reporter, Bailiff, Other. Staff fields: name (single), phone, email.

- Document Generator: upload .docx templates, define placeholders, auto-fill from case data + party data; visibility (global/personal); full re-edit of placeholders (add/remove/modify fields) restricted to creator + Shareholders
- Email Correspondence: SendGrid Inbound Parse captures emails to case-{id}@mail.mattrmindr.com
- Authentication: bcrypt passwords, temp password emails, forgot/reset password flow, forced password change on first login

## Auth System
- Passwords stored as bcrypt hashes in `password_hash` column
- Password requirements: 8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, 1 special character (enforced on backend + frontend)
- `must_change_password` flag forces password change after temp password login
- `temp_password` column stores plaintext temp passwords (cleared after use)
- Admin (App Admin role) can send temp passwords to any user via Staff Directory
- Forgot Password: sends reset code via email, valid for 1 hour
- New users automatically receive temp password email on creation
- Users can change their own password from the sidebar
- Deleted/deactivated users cannot log in; active sessions are invalidated via auth middleware
- User soft-delete: `deleted_at` column on users table; App Admin can deactivate and restore staff
- Only App Admin can create or delete users; only App Admin can view deactivated staff list

## Architecture Notes
- **DB migration path**: All DB access via REST API — swap `DATABASE_URL` to point to Supabase, swap `express-session` for JWT, done.
- **Standard SQL only**: No Replit-specific extensions — schema is portable.
- **Task chains**: Completing certain tasks auto-generates follow-up tasks (`TASK_CHAINS`, `DUAL_CHAINS`) — business logic stays client-side for now.
- **Auto-escalation**: Task priority rises automatically as due date approaches. Thresholds are customizable per-task (default: Medium ≤30d, High ≤14d, Urgent ≤7d). Stored in `escalate_medium_days`, `escalate_high_days`, `escalate_urgent_days` columns.
- **Activity logging**: Tracked per-case via `/api/activity`.
